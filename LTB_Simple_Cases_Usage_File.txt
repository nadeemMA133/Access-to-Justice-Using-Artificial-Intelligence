Below is Python code that:

Fetches text from an HTTPS URL

Searches for relevant keywords (“Landlord”, “Tenant”, “LTB”)

Checks whether rent was paid in the last 60 days (a Boolean condition the text must contain)

Produces a decision:

If rent NOT paid → Order to vacate due to non-payment

If rent paid → No eviction based on non-payment

This example assumes the HTTPS source includes (or you can embed) a line such as:
rent_paid_last_60_days: yes or rent_paid_last_60_days: no


# -------------------------
# Example Usage
# -------------------------

url = "https://example.com/sample_case_text.txt"  # Replace with real HTTPS source
output = analyze_case(url)

print(output)

For example:

Landlord: John Doe
Tenant: Jane Smith
rent_paid_last_60_days: no
