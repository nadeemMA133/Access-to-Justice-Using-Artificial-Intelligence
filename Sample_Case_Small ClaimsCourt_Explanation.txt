This is a sample (basic) code for modular Python example that follows the logic.
It:

Takes case filing date and checks whether it is 3 years old or more → if yes, mark as priority.

Takes dispute amount → if ≤ $35,000, collect more details.

If > $35,000, route to a judge.

Otherwise (≤ $35,000), route to an AI engine for decision.

You can adjust prompts, logging, and integrations as needed.
